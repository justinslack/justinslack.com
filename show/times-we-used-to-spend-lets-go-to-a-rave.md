# Show Thirteen - May 2021

Hello, and welcome to episode 13. This month, we are delving into what I'm loosely going to call early rave records starting around 1988 and ending around 1993. We'll take in some of the early bleep stuff released on Warp Records and the like, move through some breakbeats, slash hardcore kind of stuff, and then what generally gets referred to as proto- jungle. Early releases that aren't quite jungle yet are still coming out of the tail-end of hardcore but very much pointing the way forward. Right. Let's get into it. 

The one and only Gerald Simpson, AKA, A Guy Called Gerald. As I've mentioned before, one of my favourite producers of all time, especially his jungle releases.

This was his first release as A Guy called Gerald, VodooRay. It came out in 1988, and this is the remix, simply called Vodoo Ray remix. Interestingly, the original sample that he did from some TV show or something was actually voodoo rage, but early sampler technology didn't have enough memory to actually include the whole phrase.

So it ended up being "voodoo ray". A Guy called Gerald was in one of the really influential bands of that time making house music in the UK. And that was 808 State, of course, but he left them under less than pleasant circumstances.

Nevertheless, 808 State were significant pioneers of electronic music in the UK, particularly in the north of England in Manchester, centred around the legendary Hacienda club. This is probably the most well-known track from that period.

That's the wonderful Pacific 202 by 808 State. I have quite a few versions of this on various 12 inches, and I wasn't sure which one I should play. I like all of them except the Grooverider rider mix; that's rubbish. This version is from the  90 album, which came out in 1989.

I don't think there's a bad track on there. It brings together all sorts of different influences from electro, from acid, from early techno breakbeats; it's all there. A couple of years ago, people were playing this a lotâ€”a good choice.

While A Guy Called Gerald, 808 State and the like were creating this music up in Manchester, there was another musical genre brewing in the Midlands of the UK, centred around Sheffield and a little label you may have heard of called Warp Records. 

That's Nightmares On Wax with Aftermath, from their 1990 release, backed with I'm for real on the other side. Both incredible tracks. This is sampling Jam On It by Nucleus, a really well known old track.  This was the fourth or fifth release on Warp, maybe a bit later. This is my favorite of the early stuff, and very much falls into the the birth of a new genre that came to be known as bleep or a bleep and bass or beep techno, whatever you want to call it.


Bleep was largely centred around Warp Records and artists like Sweet Exorcist, Forge Masters, LFO, Tricky Disco and so on. Warp of course changed direction a bit when they started moving to the Artificial Intelligence series and embraced what was horribly called intelligent techno. Amazing music, terrible name. 

This track still sounds so fresh to me. And so highly, highly influential. 

One of the other really important early records that also came out on Warp in 1990m was Testone by Sweet Exorcist. And I am going to play Testtwo from that 12 inch.

Sweet Exorcist were Richard H. Kirk and DJ Parrot. Kirk had his roots in Sheffield industrial music and experimental stuff as part of a Cabaret Voltaire, a very important band as well. He was also in Xon and The Technocrats and so on, and also did a lot of solo stuff and collaborative work within the house and techno scene of the time,

This track almost sets a blueprint for minimal techno in a way -- the 808 percussion. A classic classic of the bleep genre and doesn't sound dated at all to me.

Sheffield is interesting in the sense that, much like Detroit, it's a very industrial city. It's no coincidence that the music that comes out of that social and economic milieu mirrors the geography and the spatial dimensions of its place. So we have this very kind of robotic mechanical sound to the music.

Right. One more warp track. And this time, we going to go a little bit forward in time and have sending from LFO. Again, I have a bunch of LFO records and I wasn't sure which one to play. So I thought I'd just go with one that's kind of friendly and nice to listen to beause some of their stuff is quite harsh, not in a bad way. Just, maybe not for listening. 

That's LFO with Love Is The Message from 1991, LFO was Gez Varley and Mark Bell, pioneers of bleep and early techno in the UK. They brought dso many idspaarte influences, doing stuff with breakbeats and acid and all sorts of mash-ups of genres. Mark Bell unfortunately passed away, about a decade ago. I actually played one of his tracks on my previous show, the techno one, that he did under the his Clark alias.

 So bleep, bleep, techno bleep, and bass, whatever you want to call, was a really important, important part of early rave music in the UK. And it was very much the stuff that was played at warehouse parties and raves and so on around this time. It was influenced by a whole range of things from hip hop to electro, to early techno coming out of the US, early Chicago house, all these kinds of things, but also homegrown, UK music.

In particular, what is really important to this was the reggae aspect of sound system culture in the UK. This brought a heavy bass influence. One of my LFO records actually has a warning that says that the bass on this may damage your home Hi-Fi equipment. It's made for these massive signs systems with huge bassbins and that's very much a part of a sound system culture that's coming into play.

Bass on bleep records is very different to the kind of bass that you hear in your traditional techno or house records at the time. It's a lot, lot more pronounced and that would lead into more breakbeat stuff that started then experimenting with even deeper bass frequencies and sub-bass. Thsi would  mutate into hardcore and eventually jungle and drum and bass, and then speed garage, two-step, dubstep, all following that trajectory. That's what really ties UK music together -- the importance of the bass above all else. 


An obvious one, but what a track that is. That's Papua New Guinea by Future Sound Of London. The Monsoon mix from the 12 inch that came out in 1992. The sample on this is from the 4AD band Dead Can Dance.  I think it's from Within The Realm Of The Dying Sun.

At this point we are starting to hear more breakbeats, even though it's not necessarily kind of ravey per se. This was played everywhere back in the day and everyone would go mad when they heard it. Absolutely beautiful track. Future Sound Of London are still going and incredibly prolific. Papua New Guinea kind of straddles that ambient/breakbeat/rave divide. Highly influential it would go on to be copied by all these terrible bands like Enigma and Deep Forest and the like which we really don't need.

More coming soon!!!!


<!-- That's the dub mix of Close Encounters by Bassix. Bassix was Andre Jacobs, another important figure in this era. He started the diesel and records label in London, and yeah, we're moving. We kind of keep moving progressively south through the UK through arts,  this show and.
 decern were very much part of the bleep era, but also embraced like acid and started getting much, much closer to what we would traditionally call like a kind of rave sound of that time. And this track very much kind of straddles those two, two areas, I would say.  but you know, it's still got a lot of that bleep influence and you can hear that in the, in the, in the baseline, but then also starting to throw in the kind of samples and going more maximal rather than minimal.

 as, as rave and hardcore, and breakbeats progressed as a genre, it became very much embracing, like anything goes rather than the rather more austere, early days, of. That's pure pleasure by digital exhortation. Also known as Frank to Wolf, you might be familiar with people who went to that early technical Belgian, techno scientist was on, RNs records, but the original of this is terrible.

It's like a real horrible Euro. Try and see nonsense. w what'd we just seem to hear is the rave mix. And this was actually done by a Damon wild, who actually talks about in my technician as well. He founded science sign, wave records in New York, but this was one of his early mixes. And there's some story that they were supposed to do this together, and then they fell out or whatever.

And,  this was released as one of the mixers, but. This is great. I mean, it's really got that early rave sign to it. No question why it's called, for the rave mix and you can see here breakbeats more pinners coming in. There's there's a lot more samples, including one from VOD Ray, which we started the show with that's humanoid by stacker originally came out in 1988,  way, way, way back.

 So many years ago and humanoid, no, hang on. Stacker, humanoid by humanoid. Yeah. I always get confused by that.  that, which was actually Brian Duggins, who went on to become one half of,  future sound of London. So, you know, these things are all linked or they're not,  this is. Really I, to my mind, one of the kind of attack that kicks off kind of a split between, you know, your house and garage scene, as we would have known from, you know, Chicago house and acid and stuff like that,  into what we could.

Generally lump altogether as kind of a rave music scene, it's way faster than, than, than this stuff coming out of Chicago. Or that obviously owes a huge debt to that with a three or three in the acid line and,  the beats, but it's a lot faster and you can also hear a lot of electro in it, but then it's also bringing in these,  These,  samples are from all over the place again, and that's really starting to birth a new kind of genre.

This was actually a charts top of the charts in the UK in 1988, everybody. Believe it or not, they're lost. I can underground rave Trek becoming I wasn't sure which track include again. I mean, there are hundreds of copies on the influential rave stuff that they did, especially tracks like frequency and overload,  evaporates, Armageddon, and so on.

 but they thought, I think. Given short shrift, you know, there was this real divide that started to happen in, in music at this time between this kind of stuff that was seen as a  cartoon nonsense and like real house and real techno blah-blah-blah and all that stuff, you know, that could proper gentrification happening.

And you'd see this happen later with, with jungle and German basis, you know, again it's. Cleaves off into all these sub-genres and like become this coffee table music in the guise of black liquid or whatever the hell you want to call that what a terrible name and so on. But you also get this kind of thing happening,  here.

And, you know, you got the real house heads, you know, this is nonsense, kitty raver, et cetera, et cetera.  you know, it's really beyond me, why you can't love breakbeat hardcore and, you know, We're on train records at the same time, because of course you can. But here we seeing like almost what we could call proto jungle in a sense, like the breakbeats are getting much more breaky for want of a better word, as opposed to like a more linear for four-star that we had before.

 and we started to bring in these vocal samples that are usually from older from R and B or soul records or things like that. And that very much makes its way into. Into early jungle, high tech music by DG D there has an X, 10 S C I V. Yeah. I don't know anything about these people or what it is this record I have it's black got no information on it, except the name and the track.

I think it might be a promo of some sort. This came out in 91.  really a classic breakbeat hardcore track.  really not much to say about it's.  It's just a, you know, very much a sound of the times. And we can see the, the Al all the influences coming into play here from breakbeats rave, stabs,  samples, et cetera, a very representative, track of the genre and the time.

So, I guess I couldn't really do this show without, including something from,  the prodigy.  I'm not the biggest fan of prodigy, and I liked some of their tracks, and you know, some of them are pretty blur.  but there's no doubt that they were an important band and an important part of this era of music.

 and you know, quite prolific, and, and sold tons and tons of records, you know, they really,  for this time, The a lot of these records just got into pop charts and all kinds of things with rave act appearing on top of the pops dancing around and,  in ridiculous fashion to backing tracks.  quite ridiculous.

Of course, the early, early, prodigy was really just, Liam harlots and no one else,  until the other band members joined, later on. This check I'm going to play is kind of an obvious one. And probably one of the better known early tracks it's called, everybody in the place and I had is the fairground, remix, and it comes from it.

It was released in 1991 on XL recordings, which of course a fairly major label, Affiliated at the time, the prodigy, everybody in the place does what it does. Okay. The next check I'm going to play is one of my absolute favorites from in this, from around this time, it's called hurt you. And it's by Johnny L who would disappear for a bit and then reappear in the 10 step era of jungle with a.

Check then that became a massive, massive thing on the scene. But this is like for me, really, really emblematic of this kind of early breakbeat hardcore stuff. Edging slowly towards jungle. That's Johnny L with Hershey, sir. a classic of the time,  released in. 19. Gosh. Now, when was it released? I can't remember.

Early nineties, 93 or so.  the Len Collins think about it, break chopped up, which would become a staple of the jungle scene and a drum and bass scene, used a lot by people like vo-tech,  puts a smile on your face. Does this record Danielle what's ahead. A huge,  Drum and bass track around in the tech stack tech step era, called Piper,  which is pretty good, very much of that era, also, but, worth checking out.

Okay. Now I'm going to play some, three tracks now that are all from the same label. And that label is reinforced. The label started by digo and mark Mac also known as four hero amongst many other things, and they. It started off very much in this, in the hardcore break, beat space, but started bringing really, really interesting, influences into the beats, the samples, and started to become very different and mutates a little bit.

And I think the, that the, the stuff that they were doing early on in the early nineties would find its. Kind of combination in their parallel universe alb, which was released in 1994, which I guess fits very much into jungle and drum and bass at the time, but still, leans back towards the very sample-heavy moments of their, their earlier, earlier releases.
 Unreinforced, so the first check I'm going to play is by Mannix,  which was either mark or Degas. I'm not sure. And then the second one is the Mannix remix of tech nine and tech nine was,  either mark or David Degas. I can't remember. I will do I'll check that out and get back to you. And then I'm also gonna play an early track by Goldie,  and he's roughage crew, alias, which.

Really is a phenomenal record. And, but still, still has its foot in this hardcore era. But again, very much prefacing what he would go on to do with both moving shadow and then later metalheads. Right? So first up is Mannix and,  The original mix of you. Hold my hand. Right? That's Mannix, mark, Claire, or mark Mac, half a four hero a, you held my hand, the original mix that came out in 1992 on the badass, two 12 inch, as a say on reinforced records and really amazing, amazing, record.
 it's really, really well juiced.  listen to it. You can't really. I believe it came out in as long ago as 1992. So that's shop beats and really amazing,  samples. So now we're gonna move on to tech nine.  you've got to slow down. That's the Mannix remix of tech nines. Slow down. As I mentioned, Mannix, mark Mac and tech nine.

I have done my research, Degas, both, a full hero again, just checking here. There's still, I've got that very kind of four, four-beat, but interspersed with the breakbeats, the piano strings sources of samples, and then the vocal, you know, sped up to match the beats.  technology would evolve, like a year or two later in sampling, too.
 to do, you know, proper matching of beats of, focused humps to tempo. But at this stage you can hear it's all stretched out and,  much faster than, than the original, the original of course, being,  Stephanie Mills,  you're putting a rash on me,  and the, that slow that you've got to slow down,  sample that, The tech nine use here,  that is coincidentally, that Stephanie most track would become a speed garage Anthem.

Like a mid nineties remixed by a grad Nelson, one of the kind of leading lights of, of that scene. So the scan reinforced records, it's on a 12 inch called,  the return of tech nine. Goldie was also in, involved in, in the production of this, very much, he was very much a part of early, reinforced records.

 and.  all his early releases, as roughage crew, came out on,  on, on reinforced.  so he very much got his, got his,  Got his start there. So I'm going to play an early Goldie check on reinforced from 1993. And this is from the ghosts CP and unsurprisingly. It's called a ghost of my life.

And,  again, what? Yeah, one of Goldie's early, early tracks and a really important and influential lease at Ron this time that gain would lead to what we would later see as jangling. Drum and bass and then, preoccupation. So that whole metal EDS era. As I said, that's Goldie with ghosts of my life on reinforced records, 1993, under the, his roughage crew name.

And this is the ghost EAP. this, this is an amazing, amazing release. The whole thing. It's got the Terminator to remix on ERT. It's got a fabulous ghost and another track whose name is. Capes me.  yeah, so the, the, the sample at the beginning and throughout,  go. So my life is actually from, Japan, 1980s, kind of new wave band, amazing band to check them out.

If you don't know them and their lead singer, David Sylvian, who had gone to,  a. It's a solo career. And,  as a, as a singer and songwriter artists and amazing ne  influential and amazing career that he's had, and other members of Japan also released some amazing records on their own. So, you know, just delve into that as well.

It's really worth looking into, but you know, Japan, a big influence on,  And David Sylvian in particular, a big influence on Goldie.  so you can see this, this track again, you know, it's getting a little, it's getting much darker than the kind of earlier. Breakbeat kind of hardcore early jungle stuff that whatever you want to call it,  Th there's a lot more, it's a lot more claustrophobic since stabs are a lot more menacing.

The whole vocal refrain the ghosts of my life.  you know, the track that it samples itself is incredibly melancholic, record,  you know, the, the F from, from, from Japan and Sylvian, and then the other vocal sample is actually from first choice. So.  you know, let no man put asunder kind of, I guess, a disco soul track from Ansel soul from, from the early eighties.

So these very, very disparate influences that come from together and form this musical genre,  that we, that we come to know as, as hardcore, as jungle drum and bass, whatever we want to call it. Yeah. I feel like I've been talking a lot in the show, but anyway,  yeah, so I've tried, I've tried to like draw a line between where.

Dance music in, in the UK from the late eighties up until like the early nineties really starts to take on a life of its own and become its own thing, as opposed to just a copy of what was happening in the United States and Chicago house and Detroit, techno, and New York,  and those kind of makers and founding original places of,  I've done some music at the time.

And, and as I mentioned, and the, and that runs through, you know, Manchester and the Hacienda scene around eight, eight state and Geico Gerald, and all those kinds of people. And down into the Midlands and Sheffield, which already had a really, really strong electronic music scene,  embracing the acid acid house in bracing, techno, and then Dan to London, where we breakbeats and hardcore and jungle really.

Find their feet and become a separate genre on their own. The music writer, Simon Reynolds. He has this thing that he calls the hardcore continu which for him is like a thread that runs through, the kind of historical moments of, of. Dance music in the UK from the late eighties, right up until the present.

And he locates that in early bleep stuff where we hear the influence of the base through hardcore, through breakbeat through jungle, through diamond bass, through speed garage, two-step through dubstep through funky house and,  and so on. And yeah, so I've kind of tried to give that kind of feel like these things are all related and they're related because of the huge attention that's being paid to the base and bringing to what.

What us tasks and technic didn't have. And that was that huge reggae sound system influence and the primacy of bass in UK dance music. I guess I'm going to end with a track that, to me, that really much epitomizes the. kind of hardcore jungle breakbeats space scene, and it's something I actually never had at the time.

And I mean, I've been searching for it for forever. And I finally managed to get my hands in a copy of act last year. It cost me an absolute fortune, but,  to my mind, it was worth it. It was absolutely worth it. And that's the euphoria Nino's dream mix.  by the house crew, and yeah, I'm just going to let that play out, and I'll see you next time.

Thanks for listening as always. -->
