# Show Thirteen - May 2021

Hello, and welcome to episode 13. This month, we are delving into what I'm loosely going to call early rave records starting around 1988 and ending around 1993. We'll take in some of the early bleep stuff released on Warp Records and the like, move through some breakbeats/hardcore kind of stuff, and then what generally gets referred to as proto- jungle. Early releases that aren't quite jungle, are still coming out of the tail-end of hardcore, but very much pointing the way forward. Right. Let's get into it.
