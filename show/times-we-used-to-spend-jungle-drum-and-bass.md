Music is so special. The theme for this month is drum and bass and jungle and I'll be playing some records from my collection dating from the early to mid 90s. Which is by far the best time for drum and bass and jungle. Actually the only time. I wouldn't bother with any stuff outside of this period, and I'll talk some more about that later.

The track we're listening to now is unsurprisingly, *Music is so special*, it's by Mystic Moods, which was Basement Phil who ran the Basement Records and Street Beats labels. A really important figure who released all the early stuff by people like Roger Johnson, Peshay, Photek, Source Direct in their early guises like Sounds of Life.

This track was done with LTJ Bukem, known for Good Looking Records, and also Looking Good of course, it came out in 1996.

So the style of Drum and Bass jungle that this kind of fits into was called numerous things. One of which was ambient drum and bass, which I think was coined by Simon Reynolds, the music journalist who's written a lot about jungle but also the really terrible term "intelligent" Drum and Bass as if all the other music surrounding it is somehow stupid. We saw this also with IDM or intelligent dance music. It's kind of a gentrification of the sound. Let's move it away from the sweaty dance floors and raves, and so on and move away from terms like jungle which had been embraced by the community. Although there were some original objections to the term jungle particularly from Shut Up and Dance in the UK jungle having a rather racist connotation, but that term was embraced by most artists in the jungle community.

So intelligent drum and bass is an absolutely terrible name but it generally first of its kind of more, I suppose tilde listening style, although you may not hear it, you know, if you're listening to this on, you know, little headphones or something, but the bass in this is still really, really present. And when you hear this music on a really big sound system with a huge basement, it's it's very powerful, you know, which you don't necessarily get listening to it at home. So there's lots of sub bass still.
