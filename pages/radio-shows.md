*Times We Used To Spend* is a two hour ramble through my record collection making connections between eras, genres, melodies and rhythms. Each show will have a theme and will embrace all forms of music with no allegiance to any particular genre. One month may be 90s Detroit techno while the next may be 80s Indie Rock. The only criterion for inclusion is that it's in my record collection. *Times We Used To Spend* is NOT a DJ mix but a platform for discovery, connection and conversation.

*Times We Used To Spend* is hosted by [The Other Radio](https://www.mixcloud.com/TheOtherRadio/).
