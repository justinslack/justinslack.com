This episode is about a club called The Funktion that ran for two years in the mid 90s. It is the story of the music we played at our residency on Friday nights. But more importantly it is also a tribute to and remembrance of Matthew Buck who we unfortunately lost in 2019. Matt was co-founder of the Funktion and the heart of the music that was played there. This show is dedicated to him.

## Track list and narrative

### Andrea Parker - Fallen Arches - Mo Wax (1996)

[Andrea Parker - Melodious Thunk](https://www.discogs.com/Andrea-Parker-Melodious-Thunk/release/31584)

Our story starts towards the end of 1995. Trevor Mitchell and Nick Birkby had been doing a night called Acid Jazz influenced by all things Gilles Petersen at The Lounge in Long Street but were outgrowing the venue. The ambient club I had co-founded and was resident at for two years had recently closed. We had decided to do a night embracing all forms of electronic music regardless of genre and were looking for a suitable venue. 

Trevor always had his ear to the ground and mentioned a new venue we should check out. Some time in December we walked into the Funktion on the corner of Loop and Shortmarket streets and spoke to co-owner Philip Bartholomew about doing a night at the new venue. I am pretty sure Philip was very skeptical of these chancers off the street at first. But we invited him to the Lounge to come and see for himself what we were doing. As luck would have it it was absolutely rammed with people and we were offered Friday nights to promote an evening of, well, anything goes really. 

Our first night at the Funktion was on 13 January 1996. It was called Elastica. We soon changed that name though.

### Funki Porcini - It’s a Long Road - Ninja Tune (1995)

[Funki Porcini - It's A Long Road / Poseathon](https://www.discogs.com/Funki-Porcini-Its-A-Long-Road-Poseathon/release/29240)

Ninja Tune was a big part of what we played back then. Part of the nascent trip hop scene, which promised so much. "fucked up, anything-goes neo-B-boy abstraction" as Simon Reynolds put it. The track we are listening to now is "It's a long rd" by Funki Porcini which came out on Ninja Tune in 1995. Sad to say Ninja Tune of this era hasn't had much longevity. All your London Funk All Stars, 9 Lazy 9 and whatnot sound distinctly dated now. I still have a soft spot for this one though.

### 4 Hero - Escaping Categories - SSR (1995)

[Various - Freezone 2: Variations On A Chill](https://www.discogs.com/Various-Freezone-2-Variations-On-A-Chill/release/144426)

Only available on the second Freezone compilation, the awfully named Variations On A Chill, this track was a beautifully languid slice of downtempo loveliness. An unusual outing for 4 Hero best know for tearing drum and bass and jungle at the time. A staple of the early evening. 

### Nightmares on Wax - Stars - Warp (1995)

[Nightmares On Wax - Smokers Delight](https://www.discogs.com/Nightmares-On-Wax-Smokers-Delight/release/23661)

Well we couldn't do this without something by Nightmares on Wax. And in particular something from Smokers Delight. Nights Introlude was probably played the most but I always had a soft spot for Stars. This is the album version but the remixes on the Still Smoking 12" are well worth your time. A classic of its time.

### Air - Modular Mix - Source Lab (1995)

[AIR - Modulor Mix](https://www.discogs.com/AIR-Modulor-Mix/release/191496)

Air's first release on the French Source Lab label. This was later released on Mo Wax with a lovely drum and bass remix by Source Direct. 

### Bone Thugs and Harmony - 1st Of Tha Month (The Kruder & Dorfmeister Session Part 3) - Ruthless 1995

[Bone Thugs-N-Harmony - 1st Of Tha Month](https://www.discogs.com/Bone-Thugs-N-Harmony-1st-Of-Tha-Month/release/226475)

One of the things that characterised this era was the general anything goes nature of music releases. I have always been a big hip hop and r'nb fan and while I bought a lot of those records I didn't play them out much. If at all. This record straddled those interests in so many ways. A mainstream hip hop group remixed by fairly obscure (at the time) stoner downtempo producers from Vienna. The Kruder & Dorfmeister mix of Bone Thugs and Harmony's 1st Of Tha Month. This 12" came out in 1995 and Part 3 which we are listening to now would later be included on the K and D Sessions. The kind of track that encapsulated the musical approach of Fridays at the Funktion. 

### The Mighty Bop - Mellow - Yellow Productions (1995)

[The Mighty Bop Meet DJ Cam Et La Funk Mob](https://www.discogs.com/The-Mighty-Bop-Meet-DJ-Cam-Et-La-Funk-Mob-The-Mighty-Bop-Meet-DJ-Cam-Et-La-Funk-Mob/release/125236)

Many trip hop productions of the mid-90s came from France, and in particular Paris. The Mighty Bop, whose track Mellow we are listening to now,  was Alain Ho, better known as DJ Yellow, and Christophe Le Friant better known as Bob Sinclair and as part of Africanism. I have no interest in their other activities but The Mighty Bop released some sublime records in the mid 90s, perfect amalgamations of hip hop beats and beautiful melodies. This track is from a 1995 release shared with DJ Cam and Le Funk Mob.  More about them later. 

### DJ Cam - Dieu Reconnaîtra Les Siens - Street Jazz Productions (1994)

[DJ Cam - Abstract Hip Hop Volume 1](https://www.discogs.com/DJ-Cam-Abstract-Hip-Hop-Volume-1/release/154065)

All the way back to 1994 for this one. On Paris label Street Jazz Productions and Cam's second release. This track was an ideal one for moving into more beat-y territory as the night progressed.

During the day the Funktion was a hair dresser, a coffee shop and a clothes store. More important to us was Grooves of Distinction, the record store started by Matt and run by Rob White. Rob and I met at the Funktion and have been friends ever since. He has been a huge influence on my musical endeavors. 

Rob was both record store buyer and resident DJ for Saturday's Deep house night at the Funktion. I spent so many hours browsing those shelves and there's a good chance that all the tracks we are listening to now I bought from Rob. Rob has very kindly sent some thoughts on Matt and the Funktion. We will hear from him a bit later in the show.

### Major Force E.M.S. Orchestra Vs. UNKLE - Time Has Come - Mo Wax (1994)

[Various - Mo Wax vs. Major Force: Time Has Come](https://www.discogs.com/Various-Mo-Wax-vs-Major-Force-Time-Has-Come/release/1089338)

If there was one label, and sound, we were obsessed with at this time it was Mo Wax and I bought anything of theirs I could get my hands on. Launched in 1992 by James Lavelle (when he was 19 years old or something ridiculous) their early acid jazz type productions quickly gave way to more abstract beat stylings and a sound that embraced hip hop, electro, breakbeat and jungle. The label introduced the world to both DJ Shadow and DJ Krush and resurrected the career of Kool Keith amongst many things. Impeccably designed with graphics by Futura and typography by Swifty (also designer of Straight No Chaser our bible at the time), my Mo Wax records are up there with the most prized in my collection.

This track is label founder James Lavelle's UNKLE project while Shadow was still a member, remixed by Japan's legendary beat crew Major Force. I could have gone with any Shadow or Krush record but this is probably my favourite on the label. 

### Le Funk Mob - Motor Bass Get Phunked Up (Electrofunk Remix) - Mo Wax (1994)

[La Funk Mob - Breaking Boundaries Messing Up Heads](https://www.discogs.com/La-Funk-Mob-Breaking-Boundaries-Messing-Up-Heads-EP-Casse-Les-Fronti%C3%A8res-Fou-Les-T%C3%AAtes-En-LAir/release/29578)

By February 1996 we had changed the name of the night to Stretch. Bruno Morphet who was DJ'ing up the road at The Magnet was doing the flyer design and we started to get a bit more adventurous with the music selection. Still on Mo Wax this is a track by Le Funk Mob, French beat makers who would go on to be Cassius but we don't care about that bit. This is from the Breaking Boundaries Messing Up Heads EP and the remix is by none other than Richie Hawtin. A testament to the title of the release this double 10" had this mix by Hawtin as well as mixes by Carl Craig and Nightmares on Wax. If you ever wondered what Hawtin would sound like unleashed on some breakbeats here you go.

### Palmskin Productions - The Beast (Autechre Mix) - Mo Wax (1994)

[Palm Skin Productions - The Beast (Remix)](https://www.discogs.com/Palm-Skin-Productions-The-Beast-Remix/release/64381)

A decidedly average release is turned into a wonder of beauty and contemplation. Autechre remix Palmskin Productions The Beast. This 12" also has two wonderful drum and bass mixes by Global Communication in their Links guise and by the Bristol trio of Krust, Roni Size and Suv. Cheap on Discogs. 

Mo Wax lost their way though. The sprawling incoherent Headz 2 compilation, the underwhelming Excursions sub-label and a disastrous deal with Sony saw it folding in 2002. But for a brief period in the mid 90s it was untouchable.

### Move D - Amazing Discoveries - Source Records (1995)

[Move D - Kunststoff](https://www.discogs.com/Move-D-Kunststoff/release/14432)

While we primarily played breakbeat orientated records on Fridays there was also space for more four four type tracks. This is from Move D's Kunststoff album released in 1995. Very much a European record but influenced by Detroit and a very much like the kind of techno coming out in the UK at the time on labels like Likemind, Irdial, Buzz, Warp and Planet E. A beauty.

### Nuron - Mirage - Likemind - 1994.

[Nuron / Fugue - Likemind 02](https://www.discogs.com/Nuron-Fugue-Likemind-02/release/5854)

Speaking of Likemind this is Mirage by Nuron on the aforementioned label. I am not going to say much about this it speaks for itself.

That's the impeccable Nuron who has recently returned after 25 years of silence. Check out his new release on De:tuned.

### Ballistic Brothers - I'll Fly Away

[The Ballistic Brothers* - I'll Fly Away](https://www.discogs.com/The-Ballistic-Brothers-Ill-Fly-Away/release/16009)

So drum and bass and jungle. I have to admit to a lifelong obsession with early to mid-90s drum and bass and jungle. On some days I may say it's the best music ever made. At the Funktion we played the more Bukem/Fabio inspired end of the spectrum as it fit perfectly with the more downtempo beats and the house and techno we also played. This track by The Ballsitic Brothers is a perfect example of that sound. 

I think this track was kind of lost to the jungle scene at the time as it was released on Boys Own, very much a purist house label, and made by members of Black Sceince Orchestra. Still, I played the hell out of it.

### The Sentinel - Pulse of Life - Basement (1994)

[The Sentinel - Heavy Vibes / Pulse Of Life](https://www.discogs.com/The-Sentinel-Heavy-Vibes-Pulse-Of-Life/release/77036)

Sentinel is Photek. Enough said.

Some time in 1996, I don’t remember when, @we changed the name of the night to Blu and Bruno Morphet had designed a striking identity for the flyers based on Reid Miles' iconic Blue Note album covers, using a contemporary artist each week . Instead of Dexter Gordon we had Ol Dirty Bastard. Thanks for that Bruno. Those flyers still look great. 

### Justice - Soothe My Soul (Blame's Mix) - White House Records (1994)

[Justice - Soothe My Soul (94)](https://www.discogs.com/Justice-Soothe-My-Soul-94/release/74749)

Blames Mix of Soothe My Soul by Justice is as close as we would get to out and out jungle. An impeccable track that captures the sheer joy of music. 

### Lamb - Cotton Wool (A Guy Called Gerald Mix) - Fontana (1996)

[Lamb - Cotton Wool](https://www.discogs.com/Lamb-Cotton-Wool/release/19380)

Lamb was a duo from in Manchester formed in 1996 by Andy Barlow and the singer Louise Rhodes. I don't know if they are still around. They made a mix of trip-hop, jazz, dub, breaks and drum and bass. This is from the Cotton Wool 12", a remix by one of my heroes A Guy called Gerald. A fantastic example of chopping beats for maximum effect. Trevor always played the original version of this but this is the one I went for. Such a pity jungle/drum and bass has devolved into the tedium of 2 step and liquid (contender for the worst genre name in history). But that's another show.

### Abacus -Relics One - Prescription (1994)

[Abacus - The Relics E.P.](https://www.discogs.com/Abacus-The-Relics-EP/release/32940)

From the Relics EP by possibly the greatest house producer of all time Austin Bascombe. And on one of the greatest house labels of all time Prescription. We didn't play a lot of house on Fridays. Saturday at the Funktion was the deep house night. One thing about Matt was that while he never told us what to play, there was a pretty strict demarcation for him between Fridays and Saturdays. While we played a few house records we were very cognisant not to venture Too much into Saturday's territory.  

### House of 909 - So Much Love for you - Pagan

[House Of 909 - The Children We Were](https://www.discogs.com/House-Of-909-The-Children-We-Were/release/11753)

So that brings us to the end of just a part of the story. Trip hop unfortunately became a soporific soundtrack to car adverts and the subject of a million chill out and lounge compilations. And gave us the deathly dull likes of Morcheeba, while drum and bass, well, I'll say more about its decline in another show.  

In the moment though this music was so important to us and The Funktion was the only place where we could play it. Matt was largely responsible for making that possible. He is sorely missed.

### Larry Heard - So Much Joy (Repose) (1997)

[Larry Heard - The Calm & Chaos EP](https://www.discogs.com/Larry-Heard-The-Calm-Chaos-EP/master/277508)

And appropriately to end, So Much Joy by Mr Larry Heard, a reminder of the amazing times we used to spend.
