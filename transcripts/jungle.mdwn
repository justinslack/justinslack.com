 theme for this month is drum and bass and jungle and I'll be playing some records from my collection dating form the early to mid 90s. Which is by far the best time for drum bass and jungle. Actually the only time. I wouldn't bother with any stuff outside of this period, and I'll talk some more about that later.

The track we're listening to now is unsurprisingly, *Music is so special*, it's by Mystic Moods, which was Basement Phil who ran the Basement Records and Street Beats labels. A really important figure who released all the early stuff by people like Roger Johnson, Peshay, Photek, Source Direct in their early guises like Sounds of Life.

This track was done with LTJ Bukem, known for Good Looking Records, and also Looking Good of course, it came out in 1996.

So the style of Drum and Bass jungle that this kind of fits into was called numerous things. One of which was ambient drum and bass, which I think was coined by Simon Reynolds, the music journalist who's written a lot about jungle but also the really terrible term "intelligent" Drum and Bass as if all the other music surrounding it is somehow stupid. We saw this also with IDM or intelligent dance music. It's kind of a gentrification of the sound. Let's move it away from the sweaty dance floors and raves, and so on and move away from terms like jungle which had been embraced by the community. Although there were some original objections to the term jungle particularly from Shut Up and Dance in the UK jungle having a rather racist connotation, but that term was embraced by most artists in the jungle community.

So intelligent drum and bass is an absolutely terrible name but it generally first of its kind of more, I suppose tilde listening style, although you may not hear it, you know, if you're listening to this on, you know, little headphones or something, but the bass in this is still really, really present. And when you hear this music on a really big sound system with a huge basement, it's it's very powerful, you know, which you don't necessarily get listening to it at home. So there's lots of sub bass still.

We're listening to temptation by Big Bud who started releasing stuff around 1994. This is from 1995 and was released on Creative Source which was a label started by Fabio. Fabio and Grooverider are generally the originators of drum and bass and jungle from their night Rage in London, where they would play lots of hardcore breakbeat stuff, tons of house and techno and just all sorts of things. This slowly mutated into what we came to know as jungle and drum and bass. Fabio also partnered with LTJ Bukem of Good Looking on a night called speed which played more this kind of style. A really influential person in jungle, still going strong, still releasing stuff still DJing. He also had a show on Radio One, a big BBC radio station in London, that I used to listen to religiously when I was there in the 90s. An important figure.

Big Bud made some really great records but also some really forgettable stuff. This one I really like. The interplay between the the crisp beats and the sub bass and the sampled vocal. 

The pretty unmistakable beats of Photek or Rupert Parkes, this time in his Sentinel guise. As Sentinel he released three records on Basement, a label I mentioned earlier. This was the last one of those three. The track is Touelpleu, with a track called Dig Deeper on the other side. Three really amazing records that he released under the Sentinel guise.


I think this basement stuff is now I think it's all on Bandcamp so you can get hold of it quite easily now because these records are now stupidly expensive. It's crazy, like 10 years ago, jungle and Drum and Bass records were worth nothing on Discogs and now they are ridiculously expensive. I mean, we're talking, you know, close to 1000 rand for this one, I think. And some of them in the thousands. It's nuts. But fortunately, there's people like Basement Phil making all these things available digitally. So check out Bandcamp I think you can find it on there. Brilliant record.

We're listening to the mystics by PFM just Mack Bolton and someone else I can't remember his name. I released a bunch of stuff in the mid 90s on

mostly good looking records. Three acts seminal seminal 12 inch releases this one which has for all of us on the other side on the other side, both incredible tracks. One and only

And

the western

mind there for a second, Jesus three records that I really

cherish in my collection on all amazing stuff.

Funny enough, I thought it would be more kind of good looking records that I pulled out to this but

what you know, choosing things to play first of all was really hard. And I used to love good looking record so much. And

I think nowadays, I don't think this song exceptions like this track, for example, all the PFM stuff and some patchy releases and so on, but actually find out a bit dull. Most of it, to be honest, hasn't really stood out, as I say with exceptions. So I expect there to be a lot more of my good looking records in this show. And this is actually the only one which surprised me a little bit

good looking on.

No notorious copyright monsters so I hope this doesn't get the show you know bumped off and it happened with a previous

mix that was up on YouTube of mine

and all these can also be found on beatport I think has the good looking and looking good

catalog

so this is Jane john Graham aka scanner. It's SK N A Not to be confused with scanner SCA and any all sorts of purchasing around the same time.

So this is the tackled find me.

It's from 1995

scanners really great producer I'm very much in all things kind of in this bed.

Maybe with the exception of the greatest thing which is I thought about playing

Plan went for this one instead. So this still has this very linear it's got that kind of driving sound to it. And it's quite, she has a lot of similarities of some like whack stocks or releases that came around the same time on RNs but also kind of nods back to the kind of the rave era

with, you know, less complicated drum pattern, but then brings in still the sub bass and sampled vocals. Very much of its time. I just really liked the way all the elements cohere and

come together, again, I think

almost kind of stuffs on Bandcamp I'm not sure. Check

pianos and jungle slash hardcore.

a match

made in heaven somewhere. So this is Nikki

so known as Gavin Chang.

It's sort of music from

1995 the foul play remix.

He originally came out in 1992 and it was a and Nikki Gabba slash Gavin's at alias CLOUD NINE also released some amazing records especially on moving shadow. It's really kind of underrated. Last producer I think doesn't get nearly enough credit as he should easily as important as flowtech and Goldie for hero and whatnot.

This track still Steffi has that kind of rave sensibility to it. And I kind of wanted to move through the atmospheric for want of a better term tracks early on. And you know, we are going to get, you know, progressively maybe faster and harder as the show goes on.

One of the great 90 plus 90s producers with

one of my absolute favorite Drum and Bass jungle, whatever you want to call it tracks still injure and mystery with deep love remix cannot until inches earn label logic productions in 1994.

If you want to talk about prized records, this is right up there. Other sites amazing to record moods.

Dylan Jones really seminal seminal

producer in the 90s

this track is just as a weird way of calming me despite the kind of frenetic nature of the drums and

just very, very special record.

It's a real pity Dylan's got a terrible, but I'll learn about that some more later. Just let's just listen for now.

Chapter sampled drum beat sub bass and piano sampled vocal is kind of the quintessential components of a jungle drum bass track. sounds simple, but, of course, it's massively complicated and remembering that this time everything was done, you know, analog equipment with samplers that could only manage, you know, a couple of seconds at a time and the complexity of the music is very remarkable given the tools that were available.

The vocal sample and this is from CD Garrett track called kissing came out. show it's an old funk record or so. No, it's not actually it's a it's an old house record from the late 80s.

At vocal sample, I think it was by Quincy Jones or someone anyway, that doesn't really matter.

Just

The lovely arrangement on this and it's one of those tracks that just makes you feel good like so many jungle tracks that they have the structure exuberant joy to them

that you don't find in a lot of other places.

So, we listen to let love shine through by a sense of aura came out in 1995

and it samples the vocal from DSPs what would we do which is quite find quite amusing that

was a boy's own recording boys only like very like strict purist hotheads.

So I

find it quite funny that it ended up here on the kind of quintessentially moving shadow jangled track, which of course is the label.

Super important label that had been around since the early 90s. And Rob playford was an engineered gold he's timeless album

and started releasing early hardcore tracks by people like to bad myosin

Blame and

I bought an experience and so on.

Really, without moving shadow jungle would not be what it was

one of the seminal jungle tracks by Omni trio. It's the original mix of Renegade snares it came out again on weaving shadow in 1993. On each year was Rob Hey, go Hey, I'm not sure which one. It was actually an experimental and modern classical composer before. He started making jungle records in the early 90s. And he only made like maybe the first five or six releases on moving shadow are just so important and so incredibly structured.

People used to call what he did break beat science because of the way he managed to cut up these

unremarkable things and turn them into some such incredible sounding tracks. And the sample on this, for example, that taken me up comes from a really terrible, terrible house record from the early 90s. And one thing that I'm the chair was so good at was finding these things that you would these records that you would think were, you know, worthless in many ways, and really turning them into something remarkable.

I mean, when I first heard this track, all those years ago, it absolutely blew my head off. I was like, this is the most thrilling, most exciting music I've ever heard in my life. And yeah, I still think that

we're still on moving shadow and this time, the kind of mighty foul play being with you that happened bones remix, from 94 I think which can

On double 12 inch called suspected foul play have you know they they remixed amici has renamed Renegade snares into probably one of the kind of most played versions of that study the one that I always had the most art

they had a really unique and distinctive side Jackie here of our play tracking you know, it's far play, there's a serious attention to the bass and while they're kind of beats winters

experimental and cut up as the likes of say votec or source direct or omniture

they just had a real kind of groove to the sun but for want of a better word, and also have amazing use of samples and

really, really fantastic. Assessing stuff. Again, moving shadow, seminal label without them we wouldn't have this fantastic music

And now for something completely different. So this is

rollers instinct, meeting to remix track by tepa

came out in 1995. And it was done by TJ trace and Nico was the engineer. And

those are important things because this is largely regarded as the first to know what would be called techstep kind of variant of diamond base jangle so I mean, you know, there's so many sub genres of diverse in jungle most of them are absolutely terrible.

techstep became a dominant force of sand in Django for the

foreseeable future, you know, from around 95 onwards, and then people were still making you atmospheric stuff and there was like some really terrible, terrible Jazzy, john bass that you know, for

Easy Listening

nonsense, really awful.

I have kind of an ambivalent relationship with with text app. I mean, some of it, I think is absolutely amazing. And I'm going to play some of those tracks and I think those superbe and some of the most powerful music you'll ever hear. But on the other hand, I also think in many ways Tex different drum and bass in Django, because it became the only kind of style and a lot of, of exuberance and joy was kind of lost from the early jungle and more atmospheric stuff.

And

kind of went down a cul de sac very, very fast. And really, to my mind, don't invest in Django has been rubbish for over 20 years.

You know,

get into trouble for criticizing gentlemen don't basin.

Apparently I'm permanently banned from ever playing in a drum and bass and jungle party in Qatar because I wrote an article in the late 90s that was mildly critical of the scene, which is both, which I find both, you know, tragic and hilarious at the same time. I'll probably get death threats after the show for criticizing things.

Not very open minded the jungle scene.

So this track is like super important. It was the first one to use what's known as the risk baseline, which is that kind of low end rumbling sound that you hear and it came from like really obscure. Kevin Saunderson house check that came out in 1988. That was called

just another chance. At record, it's pretty it's pretty crappy actually. But that bass was taken from this had come to be known as the Reese base baseline and it's very much

The kind of dominant saunton DME base for the next few years and maybe for all time

address remix the forces electric I know you turn in 1995 midrash Nikko trace these three really

very important techstep produces I guess

this track and the other side can check

kind of

predict the way they were going to go in the future.

They know you turn label,

which is very influential. But again, you know this I love this track. I think it's amazing.

Like a dark side

as some tracks were called

You know the melodic elements of early jungle and the more atmospheric diamond bass kind of disappeared and a lot more emphasis on just the bass and the drums

This is kind of very much a pointer to to the stars that would follow

Dylan Jr. Again very much at the height of his powers with the angels fell on metal heads in

1995 we have a similar release this other two tracks on the other side, China your big and big, brutal base.

So incredible tracks.

It's very much of the text of sand of the time you know, which is one sec. It's kind of brutal, but at the same time it's so creatively danceable and

beaten in a way despite the almost kind of paranoid

feeling to it, like it's almost claustrophobic paradoxically at the same time.

It makes you want to move your body to be more cliched about it. Who was just an incredible incredible at this kind of sound

no one really sounded like this except maybe lemon D and really no surprise that they became partners.

Was that what the kids call a drop? I don't know anyone.

This track you've played loud and you feeling people off the walls and absolutely ferocious. Again, of course it's Dylan. I mean, no one does this like, like heat. Does this. Okay, maybe someone does and that's his partner in crime. lemon tea.

Pretty similar styles, but cleanser. Just

test that like extra edge in you know, beat you over the head with the bass and drums.

This is actually a remix of 88 state track by then called the zero really unremarkable track

stranded unrecognizable by this mix, except for the little vocal snippets that

that you hear this is a huge favorite of the metal heads people in London.

Kevin students dorm in particular, on all their mixes from around this time.

No, they were they would always play it.

racing track also came along with a major label, which was another interesting thing of this era of these kind of underground drum and bass and jungle producers starting to remix like these. These are major label

artists and starting to see like major labels trying to figure out how they can make money from their drum and bass and jungle scene.

The beginning of its demise stole this track is just unbelievable.

Another tech step classic jobs 95 the nasty habits remixed by

a doc Scott was on metal heads

Canada's got his kind of gold he's right and man so to speak.

really responsible for like three really important records. One was the NHS EP which came out in the early 90s which was a kind of seminal hardcore breakbeat release. And then like to techstep Records one is this, the DRAM is 95 and the other one was shadowboxing by

nasty habits. I kind of just took techstep to its logical conclusion. Yeah, this like metallic, almost industrial like collaterally drunk drums.

Less cut up and try

Then you earlier drum and bass and jungle

not much of a melody if anything at all. It's all very powerful, powerful tracks but kind of the

kind of the end point of this kind of sound. I think for me I kind of lost interest after

1996 i don't think i've any records from after then or if I

did that wrong gotten rid of them. So it's another important record.

Again very much kind of metal head sand from from this time. 

So it wasn't all metallic to step riffs and

Rhys bass lines at this time, this is a track from pesch a really

great producer.

Check out his vocal tune on goodlooking if you can samples

India famous for

To work with masters at work.

This is on the Nile and it's samples Claude Debussy, actually

three that you're hearing metal heads 1996 the other side of this is like a crazy techstep monster called creditor

couldn't have two more different styles on one one record.

So this kind of style was still being made but it was becoming increasingly like radio friendly and music for you know, selling

cars and

you know, nice furniture, things like that.

The metal heads, you know, didn't release much stuff that sounded like this. It was far more your

you know, like the Deventer track I played earlier.

This was, yeah.

Any nice counterpart to that at the time.

It's a boss

To mix the two of my favorite producers on one record, this is the two GS that's Goldie and a guy called Gerald and it's from 1995 and it's called the Reno two it also appear on Gerald's

black secret technology album. possibly one of the only good

john vassula Jungle albums.

They may be five good ones.

Yeah, this is no slightly different to what I've been the last few tracks I've been playing.

You can hear the

Canada beats more cut up.

more vocal melody

came out a label called juicebox which was run by Gerald 

saving the best to last This is internal affairs with hands to heaven on reinforced and it's from 1990

Three this whole EP the four tracks on it is like you know it's possibly the best like hardcore Drum and Bass release ever.

It's Mark Mac and Diego aka for hero and Goldie

on

for heroes reinforced level as I mentioned and kind of paved the way for the development of this particular sound, which is that it's not Django it's not hardcore.

But it definitely has massive influences from that. This focus on this, raise your hands up to heaven is actually from David Sylvian from his brilliant cheese album which came out in the mid 80s. I'm a huge David Sylvian fan. He was a singer for Japan was in the early 80s. And Goldie is kind of obsessed with him. His early track as Ravage crew called ghosts, samples, Japan extensively. So it's interesting how, you know, these kind of samples and interests come together.

This is the kind of the most, I guess, mellow for a better word track on the EP, the others are a lot more upbeat. And you can hear the hardcore

influence is amazing record.

Because there's a lot I haven't covered in the show. So records are pulled out that didn't make it in for various reasons. So you know, there's no record staff know Tom and Jerry or the verticals or anything like that.

There's no hardcore breakbeat stuff, like the origins of jungle type records. I'll try and put those into another show some other time. As usual, I've you know, documented all of this with links and whatnot on my website, you can visit the link below. And a few years ago, I did a mix of some of these records and some other ones. That's still up on mixcloud. You can follow that

on my individual profile, and then I haven't really talked about

the Tongass jungle scene in Cape Town, which was a lot of fun in the 90s for a little while, and other just that amount of time to till next time.

And so that brings us to the end of show three. Thanks for listening. And as I said before, I have a hugely ambivalent relationship with jungle and Drum and Bass kind of love hate relationship as in I love the early stuff, and I hate the contemporary stuff.

with some exceptions, you know, I started buying some new stuff a couple years ago, but it all really just sounds the same as the stuff that was made in the 90s like so. Some really good producers out there like Dead Man's Chest and Tim Reaper,

a kid love and so on, but

I'm kind of thinking that that's just nostalgia.
