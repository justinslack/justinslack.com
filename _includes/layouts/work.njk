      <p>At <a href="http://https://nml.co.za" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NML</a> I lead the design and front-end team. We are responsible for all UI design, front-end builds and design system creation. Over the last few years we have put in place design operations for a range of applications, from large financial services platforms to JAMstack based static sites.</p>

      <h2>Teaching</h2>
      <img src="/static/images/posts/fod.png" alt="Academy of Digital Arts" class="fod-logo">
      <p>For many years I taught UI design, HTML, CSS and JavaScript on both the full- and part-time programmes at the <a href="https://www.ada.ac.za/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Academy of Digital Arts</a> (formerly Friends of Design). In addition to teaching I designed course curricula, outcomes and study material for a range of student levels.</p>
      <p>I continue to teach workshops and give talks at meetups and conferences. Read more about those activities on the <a href="/about/">About page</a>.</p>
