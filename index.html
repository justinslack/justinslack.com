  <p class="lead">
    Hello, I'm <strong>Justin Slack</strong> â€” a UI designer, front-end developer, speaker and tech community organiser. I am currently head of design and front-end at <a href="https://nml.co.za">NML</a>, a specialist financial services software development company in Cape Town, South Africa.
  </p>

  <article class="home-section">
    <h2>Current work</h2>
    <p>For the past six years I have led the design and frontend team at <strong>NML</strong>. During this time we have designed and built web and mobile applications for a range of clients including <a href="https://nedgroupinvestments.co.za/">Nedgroup Investments</a>, <a href="https://www.10x.co.za/">10x</a>, <a href="https://www.silica.net/">Silica</a>, <a href="https://www.africanrainbowlife.co.za/">African Rainbow Life</a>, <a href="https://www.stanlib.com/">Stanlib</a> and <a href="https://www.pamgolding.co.za/">Pam Golding</a>.</p>

    <p>The design team has also been responsible for UI and UX design for NML-affiliated-company <a href="https://atura.ai">Atura's</a> range of chatbots for the financial services industry.</p>

    <p>For examples of the above work please visit the <a href="https://nml.co.za/work/">NML site</a>.</p>

    <h2>Past work</h2>
    <p>Prior to joining NML I worked as a freelance designer, developer and educator. Clients I worked for include Times Media (now Tiso Blackstar), Platform 45, Unlike Media, Greater Good, TUI Travel and Lightstone.</p>

    <h2>Teaching</h2>
    <p>For many years I taught UI design, HTML, CSS and JavaScript on both the full- and part-time programmes at the <a href="http://www.ada.ac.za/">Academy of Digital Arts</a> (formerly Friends of Design). In addition to teaching I designed course curricula, outcomes and study material for a range of student levels.</p> 

    <h2>Community</h2>
    <p>Being active in the front-end and design community in Cape Town is very important to me.</p>

    <p>I am a co-founder and organiser of the <a href="https://ctfeds.org">Cape Town Front-end Developer</a> meetup. Since 2012 we have run <a href="https://www.meetup.com/ctfeds/">monthly talks and workshops</a> and at last count have close to 2500 members.</p>

    <p>In addition to organising community events I also speak at conferences and meetups and have run a number of workshops. These include <a href="https://www.devconf.co.za/">DevConf</a>, <a href="http://uxsouthafrica.com/">UX South Africa</a>, <a href="https://www.meetup.com/DeveloperUG/">The Developer User Group</a>, <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Cape-Town-Scrum-User-Group-SUGSA/">The Scrum User Group</a> and <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Cape-Town-Dribbble-Community/">The Cape Town Dribbble Community</a> (full list coming soon).</p>

    <p>I am a regular at the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Codebridge/events/bznrhryznbfb/">Codebridge Community Evening</a> - a collaborative civic tech meetup - where I am part of a team of designers, developers, data scientists and journalists working on a website for the <a href="https://budgetjusticesa.org">Budget Justice Coalition</a>, a civil society coalition that aims to collaboratively build people's participation in and understanding of South Africa's budget and planning processes.</p>
